Compute the differences between two MySQL schemas.

`mydiff` is an alternative to [mysqldiff](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/mysql-utilities-1.5-en/mysqldiff.html#option_mysqldiff_difftype) that can output schema differences as migration scripts for [gh-ost](https://github.com/github/gh-ost), or as [activerecord migrations](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html)

It's written in golang, as a thin wrapper of [skeema/tengo](github.com/skeema/tengo/)

## Usage (`mydiff --help`)

```
NAME:
   mydiff - Compute the differences between two MySQL schemas

USAGE:
   mydiff --server1=user:pass@host:port:socket --server2=user:pass@host:port:socket schema_name [schema_name in server2]

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --server1 value             connection information for second server in the form of a DSN (<user>[:<password>]@<host>[:<port>][:<socket>]) or path to socket file.
   --server2 value             connection information for second server in the form of a DSN (<user>[:<password>]@<host>[:<port>][:<socket>]) or path to socket file.
   -d value, --difftype value  display differences in one of the following formats: [sql|gh-ost|ar] (default: "sql")
   -r, --reverse               show diff in reverse direction, from server2 to server1
   -v, --version               display version
   -h, --help                  display this help

## Installation

`make build` build will generate in `.build/mydiff` a linux binary with all the dependencies statically linked. The binary will be ready to be used inside any docker image or native linux distribution.

## Testing

* `make test` will run [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) and integration tests.

* `make demo` load slightly different schemas dumps in two different servers and use `mydiff` the differences using the different command options.

Both the tests and the demo will use docker-compose two spawn two mysql servers and thus mimic a real usage scenario.
    
## Design decisions and trade-offs

[skeema/tengo](github.com/skeema/tengo/) does a great job at computing differences in schemas, thus this tool does not 
reinvent the wheel and instead provides a thin wrapper atop tengo, which focuses on providing a replacement for [mysqldiff](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/mysql-utilities-1.5-en/mysqldiff.html#option_mysqldiff_difftype)
that is able to output changes as [gh-ost](https://github.com/github/gh-ost) commands, or as [activerecord migrations](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html)

Also, because [skeema/tengo](github.com/skeema/tengo/) provides [tests to ensure diffs are computed correctly](https://github.com/skeema/tengo/blob/master/diff_test.go), `mysqldiff` tests focuses instead on:
 - Ensuring `tengo.Diff` objects are parsed correctly to the different output formats. 
 - Ensuring server connections can be provided in a more flexible way than the DSN format accepted by [go-sql-driver](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/blob/877a9775f06853f611fb2d4e817d92479242d1cd/dsn.go#L374-L636)  

## Missing features

- [ ] Output diff in the different formats (ar migrations, gh-ost, etc)
- [ ] parse server connection descriptors in different formats that are more flexible than golang sqlx parser
- [ ] demo
- [ ] unit tests
- [ ] parallel comparisions for big schemas
